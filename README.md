### What are Design Principles?

**A design principle is a basic tool or technique that can be applied to designing or writing code to make that code more maintainable, flexible, or extensible.**

### What are Design Patterns?

**A design pattern is a solution to a problem in a context.**

* The **context** is the situation in which the pattern applies. This should be a recurring situation.
* The **problem** refers to the goal you are trying to achieve in this context, but it also refers to any constraints that occur in the context.
* The **solution** is what youâ€™re after: a general design that anyone can apply which resolves the goal and set of constraints.

If you find yourself in a context with a problem that has a goal that is affected by a set of constraints, then you can apply a design that resolves the goal and constraints and leads to a solution.

**Credits:** This repo is a collection of the notes I made while reading the book **Head First Design Patterns**. The Head First Design Patterns book is a great read if you are just starting to learn design patterns or if you want to learn patterns in a non-boring and non-academic way.
